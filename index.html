				<img class="selfie" src=" assets/images/Selfie.jpg" alt="selfie">

				<p>I graduated from UMD back in 2012 and shortly after landed my at-the-time dream job in Baltimore, Maryland. After a couple years in that job, I decided it was time for a change and moved to Australia for the year in 2015. While abroad I worked a number of jobs but was mostly focused on traveling and running my travel blog. Working on my blog is what started my journey into coding; I had purchased a theme and couldn’t quite customize it the way I wanted to and started looking into how I could get the site to run the way I wanted. As they say the rest is history.
				</p>

				<p>As of now, I’m working as the Activities and  Co-curricular Coordinator for a charter school but hope this course will lead to a career change. In my free time I enjoy traveling, working out, trying new restaurants, cheering on the Vikes, and spending as much time as possible with my family and friends.
